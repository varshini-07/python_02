# develop an application that prompts the user for a list of numbers and prints out the maximum and minimum of the nubers at the end when the user enters "done".
if the user enters anything other than a number , detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.The program 
should store the numbers the user enters in a list and use the max() and min() functions to compute the maximum and minimum numbers after the loop completes.

list=[]
while True:
    number=input("enter the number: ")
    if number=="done":
        break
    try:
        num=number
        list.append(int(num))
    except:
        print("invalid input")
    else:
        largest=max(list)
        smallest=min(list)
print("maximum: ",largest)
print("minimum: ",smallest)
