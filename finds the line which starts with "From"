# develop an application to read through the email data and when you find line that starts with "From" , you will split the line into
words using the split function. we are interested in who sent the massage, which is the second word on the From line.From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za sat jan 5 09:14:16 2008.
you will parse the From line and print out the second word for each From line, then you will also count the number of From (not From:) lines and print out a count at the end.


fname=input("enter the filename: ")
f=open(fname)
count=0
for line in f:
    if (line.startswith ("From")):
        s=line.split()
        print(s[1:2])
        count+=1                                     
print(f"there are {count} lines in the file with from as starting word")
