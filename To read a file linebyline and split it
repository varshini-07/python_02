# Develop an application to open the file ( say.romeo.txt ) and read it line by line . for each line, split the line into words using the split function.
for each word ,check to see if the word is already in a list. if the word is not in the list, add it to the list. when the program completes, sort and print the resulting
words in alphabetical order .



fname=input("enter the filename: ")
f=open(fname)
list=[]
for line in f:
    word=line.split()
    for element in word:
        if element in list:
            continue
        else:
            list.append(element)
    list.sort()
print(list)
