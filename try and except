#Develop an application that repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters "done". once "done" is entered, print out the total, count,average of the numbers.if the user enters anything other than 
a number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next nuumber.



total=0
num=0
average=0
while True :
    number=input("enter the number/done: ")
    if number=="done":
        break                                               
    try:
        num1=float(number)
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
    num=num+1
    total=total+num1
    average=total/num
print("\tRESULT")
print("Total numbers: ",num)
print("Total: ",total)
print("Average: ",average)
